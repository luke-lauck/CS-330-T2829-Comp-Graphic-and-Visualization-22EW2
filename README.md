## How do I approach designing software?
Software is designed by understanding each component of the system and weaving it together.  Designing the software for this milestone would have been impossible at the beginning of the class with my very limited knowledge about OpenGL.  By working with each type of system in OpenGL throughout the weeks, I have learned the components well enough to be able to weave the milestone together.

## How do I approach developing programs?
Developing programs is a whole different skillset from designing software.  It is about being able to program with adaptability.  The patterns used for each method changes as the project grows which can be seen with this milestone.  Although not suggested throughout the class, the ability to generate new meshes and render it all needs to be automated and not manually copy and pasted throughout the code.  As no one can foresee the problems that lay ahead in developing programs, I would say the approach one should take is to program as if everything can change in an instant.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Anybody looking into a computer science degree should at least understand the concepts of each sector of programming.  The best case scenerio is a job in computer graphics where this class would of been the stepping stone into being a professional.  The worst case is not touch computer graphics at all, where a class like this would help when debugging a system that might deal with graphics.  Either way, this class helps plant the roots of understanding the most basic of computational graphics.
